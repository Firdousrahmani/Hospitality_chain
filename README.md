Client: AtliQ Grands | Industry: Hospitality | Focus: Revenue Optimization**

 **Challenge**:  
AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel chain across India, was facing a decline in market share and revenue due to competitor pressure
and internal decision-making challenges. Without an in-house analytics team, they sought external expertise to unlock actionable insights from their historical data.

**My Role**:  
As a data analyst, I was tasked with transforming raw booking data into powerful insights through:

1. Metric creation (RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Occupancy %, Realisation %, etc.)
2. Interactive dashboard development based on stakeholder mock-ups
3. Generating additional insights for strategic decision-making

 **Solution - Final Dashboard Highlights**:

âœ… **Dynamic Filters** by city and room class for custom exploration  
âœ… **Key Metrics**: Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, Realisation %  
âœ… **Comparative Trends**: Weekday vs. Weekend analysis  
âœ… **Revenue Split** by category (Luxury vs. Business)  
âœ… **Weekly KPI Trends** (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %)  
âœ… **Booking Platform Analysis**: Realisation % and ADR  
âœ… **Hotel-Wise Performance Table** with complete breakdown (Total Revenue, RevPAR, DSRN, DBRN, etc.)

ðŸ“ˆ **Impact**:
- Simplified performance monitoring across cities and properties  
- Identified top and underperforming hotels at a glance  
- Revealed trends across booking platforms to optimize strategy  
- Empowered the revenue management team to make **data-driven decisions** for recovery and growth
